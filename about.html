        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>My name is Jac Faber, and I am a massage therapist based in Leland, North Carolina. I specialize in therapeutic, sports, prenatal, cupping, and hot stone massage therapy.</p>
        <p>Originally from Port Orchard, Washington, I spent my 20s traveling the world and working in humanitarian aid. In 2020, after getting married and having kids, I settled in North Carolina.</p>
        <p>Following several years as a stay-at-home mom, I was eager for a change of pace and decided to pursue a career in Massage Therapy. I love massage because I feel honored to be a part of the therapeutic process that helps people heal in both body and mind.</p>
        <p>I am passionate about providing a positive experience for those in the trans and greater LGBTQIA+ community. I understand that many of us struggle with loving our bodies, and receiving a massage is a fantastic way to tell your body that it is valuable and worth pampering. Being a part of that journey is something I deeply cherish.</p>
